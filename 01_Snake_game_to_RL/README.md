# Snake Game

After the use of OOP to have the snake working here are the phases we will use to impliment the Neural Network + Genetic Algorithm

### Phase 1 — State Representation

What does the snake "see"? You'll design a vector of numbers that describes the world. This is the input to your neural network. Every ML system starts with this question: what information does the model need?

### Phase 2 — The Neural Network

A tiny network: input layer → hidden layer → output layer. You'll build this with nothing but Python lists and basic math. You'll understand what a weight is, what a bias is, and what an activation function does — because you'll write them yourself.

### Phase 3 — The Genetic Algorithm

Instead of backpropagation (which requires calculus), you'll evolve a population of snakes. The ones that survive longest pass their "genes" (network weights) to the next generation, with small mutations. This is how nature trains neural networks.

### Phase 4 — Visualization

You'll add a live display showing the best snake's score improving across generations. This is what makes it portfolio-worthy — the story of a model learning over time.
